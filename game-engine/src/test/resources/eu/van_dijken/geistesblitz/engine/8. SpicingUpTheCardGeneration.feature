Feature: Spicing up the card generation
  The correctly colored item is only shown on a card once with each other item
  Using the features and examples you have gotten so far, we initially generate a deck of 120 cards. As the game
  requires 60 cards, this means that we have to prune a bunch of cards. Upon further analysing the deck that is in
  the actual physical game, it turns out that there is an extra rule for card generation. Each correctly colored
  game item is shown once with each other item which is then not in the correct color. This means that in a deck, we
  only have 4 cards showing a White Ghost and some other item.

  It's up to you now to think of the examples.

  Good luck!

  Scenario: 22-?.
